#Interim specification

Something that automatically creates a grid of images, that links them to relevant Facebook profiles. Need to be able to export html using inline styling.

#TODO

1. Better control of grid
2. Use jquery to allow for click-drag-adjustments
3. Ability to save out a screenshot.
